Installing PyGoWaveDesktopClient
--------------------------------

PyGoWaveDesktopClient requires Qt 4.5 or greater.

The project folder contains three subprojects:
PyGoWaveApi, JSWrapper and the PyGoWaveDesktopClient itself.

First, make sure you have QStomp and QJson compiled and installed.

Before compiling the PyGoWaveDesktopClient, the two libraries
PyGoWaveApi and JSWrapper must be compiled and installed.

Open a Shell, change into each directory and run the following commands:

  qmake -config release
  make install

The last command may need root privileges on POSIX operating systems.

After the two libraries are done. Change into the root project folder
and run the same commands.
