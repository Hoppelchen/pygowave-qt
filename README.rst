Ooh, I am curious!
------------------
  Hold your horses, this is a pre-release!
  The PyGoWave Desktop Client will be fully released on
  **December 5th, 2009**. You'll only find JSWrapper and
  the PyGoWave Qt/C++ Client API here.

License
-------
  The PyGoWave Desktop Client itself is licensed under the
  GNU General Public License. However, its two sub-projects
  JSWrapper and the PyGoWave Qt/C++ Client API are licensed
  under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Description
-----------
  The PyGoWave Desktop Client allows you to connect to any
  PyGoWave Server without using a browser. It requires less
  resources and can run in your system tray all the time,
  notifying you when you get new Waves.

Notes for developers
--------------------
  This project includes two sub-projects which can be used
  seperately: JSWrapper, a C++ to JavaScript Object wrapper
  framework for use with QtWebKit, and the PyGoWave Qt/C++
  Client API which allows you to write 3rd party clients
  and other software around PyGoWave.
